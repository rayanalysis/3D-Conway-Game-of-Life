# 3D-Conway-Game-of-Life
A game engine implementation of 3D Conway's Game of Life in Python with Panda3D.

The grid update calculation is performed in a separate thread to get the visualization closer to realtime.

You may set the grid size as large as you like, though values higher than about 25 may prove slow on desktop computers.
